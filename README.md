# Gym Hero Progress Charts

If you use the Gym Hero app (https://gymhero.me/) you can use this repo to chart your progress. 

It allows you to easily create charts from your exported workouts using a React app and Python Flask API.

You can currently view over time the volume of your workouts and the estimated one rep max of your exercises.

To change which exercises you want to see, modify the exercise name in the React App. The same for which workout you'd like to see the volume for.

This currently only works with kilograms (kg) but can be easily modified to work with pounds (lb) or other units.
